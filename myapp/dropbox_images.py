"""Mirrors every AI-generated image into Dropbox, off the request's hot path.

Generated images already land in local media storage (see
``views._ai_flux_response``). This module additionally copies them to Dropbox
under ``/vidhyora/<email>/`` so there is a durable, per-account archive — local
media is ephemeral on most PaaS hosts, so a redeploy would otherwise take every
image the users ever generated with it.

The visual evidence attached to a user's bug report (``views.ai_report_submit``)
is archived the same way, under ``/vidhyora/<email>/reports/``, so whoever
reviews the report can still see what the user was actually looking at. That is
filed beside the person's own images rather than in a separate reports tree,
because "whose images are these" is the question the folder layout answers.

Speed is the binding constraint here, so the whole module is fire-and-forget:

* ``enqueue`` performs no network, no disk and no database work. It puts a
  tuple on an in-memory queue and returns immediately, so the chat response
  reaches the browser without ever waiting on Dropbox. Uploading inline would
  add a full round trip (typically several hundred ms, and up to the timeout
  when Dropbox is slow) to every single image reply.
* One daemon worker thread drains the queue and does the uploading.
* Every failure is logged and swallowed. Dropbox being down, throttled or
  misconfigured must never turn a successfully generated image into an error
  the user sees — they still get their image from local storage either way.

The queue is bounded on purpose. If uploads back up past ``MAX_QUEUED``, new
items are dropped with a log line rather than growing until the process runs
out of memory. A dropped item costs an archive copy, not a user's image.

Because the worker is a daemon thread, anything still queued is lost if the
process exits (a redeploy, a gunicorn worker recycle). That is the accepted
trade for never blocking a reply; the queue normally drains within seconds.
