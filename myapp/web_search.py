"""Live web lookups for questions whose answer changes over time.

The model's own training data has a fixed cutoff, so anything time-sensitive
("latest", "today's price", "who won", "current rate") is answered from stale
memory unless real results are fetched first. This module supplies that
grounding text; ai_chat.stream_chat treats it exactly like the other
retrieved_context sources (see views.ai_chat_send).

Deliberately cheap and optional:

* ``needs_search`` is a narrow, explicit-signal detector rather than "search
  everything" — a search costs a network round trip on the critical path of a
  chat reply, and most turns (rewrites, code, maths, chat, company questions
  that company_knowledge.py already grounds) genuinely don't need one.
* Results are cached, so a repeated or rephrased-but-identical question in the
  same window costs nothing.
* Every failure path returns ``None`` instead of raising, so a search outage
  degrades to a normal (ungrounded) answer rather than breaking the chat.
